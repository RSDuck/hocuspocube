Don't take this serious. I hope this doesn't become a Dolphin knock-off.

## Current developement state:

- A slow PPC interpreter with terrible floating point support
- Basic VI support implemented
- Enough of GX for some basic libogc examples
- Not so bad SI implementation which is currently hardcoded to one GC controller
- The bare minimum of DSP instructions and registers to get through the initialisation
- A scheduler which is almost a direct copy of melonDS's

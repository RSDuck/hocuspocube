Don't take this serious. I hope this doesn't become a Dolphin knock-off.

## Current developement state:

- Very simple homebrew works!
- A slow PPC interpreter with terrible floating point support
- Basic VI support implemented (good enough for the libogc console)
- Not so bad SI implementation which emulates hardcoded GC controller
- The bare minimum of DSP instructions and registers to get through the initialisation
- A scheduler ~~which is almost a direct copy of melonDS's~~

Don't take this serious. I hope this doesn't become a Dolphin knock-off.

## Current developement state:

- A slow PPC interpreter with terrible floating point support and a mildy faster JIT which currently only boots homebrew
- It boots a few commercial games
- Most DSP instructions, though the ARAM accelerator is missing
- A scheduler which is almost a direct copy of melonDS's
